But technology changes very fast and in order to keep pace with it, one needs to constantly grow and develop as a professional. Free eBooks offer a great way to do that.</p><p>In this post, I’ve gathered a list of free eBooks about HTML, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Wordpress and many more. Please, enjoy!</p><h3><a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001654/index.html">HTML5 Canvas</a></h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CTx5Ly8K96ZYH1sJ-DjD_g.jpeg" /></figure><p>The second edition of <em>HTML5 Canvas</em> is geared towards a wide range of developers, from those who have never seen a Canvas to those who want to learn some intermediate-to-advanced ways to make use of the Canvas.</p><p>Every chapter has been revised with updated code and optimizations, as well as updates to address browser compatibility and other issues that have arisen over the past two years. The free online version includes 53 interactive examples and exercises.</p><h3><a href="http://www.20thingsilearned.com/en-US/home">20 Things I Learned About Browsers and the Web</a></h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1cOlpu5XpaBRkLuMkjqK7g.jpeg" /></figure><blockquote>“20 Things I Learned About Browsers and the Web” is a short guide for anyone who’s curious about the basics of browsers and the web. Here’s what you’ll find here:</blockquote><blockquote>First we’ll look at the Internet, the very backbone that allows the web to exist. We’ll also take a look at how the web is used today, through cloud computing and web apps.</blockquote><blockquote>Then, we’ll introduce the building blocks of web pages like HTML and JavaScript, and review how their invention and evolution have changed the websites you visit every day. We’ll also take a look at the modern browser and how it helps users browse the web more safely and securely.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, we’ll look ahead to the exciting innovations in browsers and web technologies that we believe will give us all even faster and more immersive online experiences in the future.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/">Adaptive Web Design</a></h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ylBNzlleFeCrMksR1vFicQ.jpeg" /></figure><blockquote>This isn’t just another web design book. It’s an essential and missing piece of the canon. Our industry has long needed a compendium of best practices in adaptive, standards-based design. And with the rise of mobile, the recent significant improvements in desktop and phone browsers, and the new capabilities that come with HTML5, CSS3, and gestural interfaces, it is even more vital that we who make websites have a reliable resource that tells us how to take advantage of these new capabilities while creating content that works in browsers and devices of all sizes and widely differing capabilities. This book is that resource.

They are based on certain syntactic and semantic rules, which define the meaning of each of the programming language constructs.</p><p>Today I’ve got a list of every programming language I could find. I divided them into the following categories:</p><ul><li>Interpreted Programming Languages</li><li>Functional Programming Languages</li><li>Compiled Programming Languages</li><li>Procedural Programming Languages</li><li>Scripting Programming Languages</li><li>Markup Programming Languages</li><li>Logic-Based Programming Languages</li><li>Concurrent Programming Languages</li><li>Object-Oriented Programming Languages</li></ul><h3>Interpreted Programming Languages</h3><blockquote>An <strong>interpreted language</strong> is a programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines already compiled into machine code. (Wikipedia)</blockquote><h4><strong>APL</strong></h4><p>Named after the book <em>A Programming Language </em>(Iverson, Kenneth E., 1962), APL is an array programming language. It can work simultaneously on multiple arrays of data. It is interpretive, interactive and a functional programming language.</p><h4>AutoIt</h4><p>It is a freeware automation language for Microsoft Windows. It’s main intent is to create automation scripts that can be used for the execution of certain repetitive tasks on Windows.</p><h4>BASIC</h4><p>Developed by John George Kemeny and Thomas Eugene Kurtz at Dartmouth in 1964, it is an acronym for <strong>B</strong>eginner’s <strong>A</strong>ll-purpose <strong>S</strong>ymbolic <strong>I</strong>nstruction <strong>C</strong>ode. It was designed with the intent of giving the non-science people an access to computers.</p><h4>Eiffel</h4><p>It is an object-oriented programming language that is ISO-standardized and used to develop extensible and reusable software. It is a development platform for many industries such as finance, aerospace and video gaming.</p><h4>Forth</h4><p>It is a structured imperative programming language, which bases its implementation on stacks. It supports an interactive execution of commands as well as the compilation of sequences of commands.</p><h4>Frink</h4><p>Developed by Alan Eliasen and named after Professor John Frink, a popular fictional character. It is based on the Java Virtual Machine and focuses on science and engineering. Its striking feature is that it tracks the units of measure through all the calculations that enables quantities to contain their units of measurement.</p><h4>Game Maker Language</h4><p>It is an interpreted computer programming language intended to be used in cooperation with Game Maker, an application for game creation. Mark Overmars, a Dutch computer scientist, designed this language.</p><h4>ICI</h4><p>Designed by Tim Long in 1992, ICI is a general purpose interpreted computer programming language. It supports dynamic typing, flexible data types and other language constructs similar to C.</p><h4>J</h4><p>Ken Iverson and Roger Hui developed this programming language that requires only the basic ASCII character set. It is an array programming language that works well with mathematical and statistical operations.</p><h4>Lisp</h4><p>Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today. The name Lisp is derived from ‘List Processing Language’. One of the important data structures that Lisp supports is linked list. Lisp programs deal with source code as a data structure.</p><h4>Lua</h4><p>Members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group developed Lua in 1993. It is an imperative and procedural programming language that was designed as a scripting language. It is known for being simple yet powerful.</p><h4>M</h4><p>M is short for MUMPS, a programming language created for the health care industry. Neil Pappalardo, the founder of medical information technology and his associates developed the M language.</p><h4>Pascal</h4><p>It is a procedural programming language that was intended to use data structuring and structured programming. Niklaus Wirth, a Swiss computer scientist designed this language and it was named after Blaise Pascal, a French mathematician and philosopher.</p><h4>PCASTL</h4><p>An acronym for <em>by Parent and Childset Accessible Syntax Tree Language</em>, it is a high-level language developed by Philippe Choquette and falls under the class of interpreted computer programming languages. It is specially designed for self-modifying code.</p><h4>Perl</h4><p>Perl is a high-level interpreted programming language that supports dynamic programming. It was developed by Larry Wall, a linguist who served as a systems administrator at NASA. It provides the programmers with text processing facilities and has a blend of features adopted from various languages like C, Lisp, and Awk.</p><h4>PostScript</h4><p>It is used in the desktop publishing field and is known as a page description language. It is a dynamically typed stack-based programming language developed by John Warnock, an American computer scientist and Charles Geschke, a notable figure in the field of computer science. These developers went on to found the very well-known company, Adobe Systems.</p><h4>Python</h4><p>It is a high-level programming language that supports imperative, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms. In its features like the dynamic type system and automatic memory management, it is similar to Perl. Originally released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch computer programmer, Python is an open community-based language whose development is managed by the Python Software Foundation.</p><h4>REXX</h4><p>Short for Restructured Extended Executor, REXX is an interpreted language developed by IBM. It was designed with an intent to be an easily learnable and readable language. NetRexx is the IBM’s implementation of REXX that offers object-oriented programming. Object REXX is an object-oriented scripting language that is based on REXX.</p><h4>Ruby</h4><p>The efforts for developing this language initiated in Japan in the 1990s. Similar to Perl, it has a dynamic type system and an automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms and is a dynamic object-oriented language.</p><h4>S-Lang</h4><p>Originally developed as a stack-based language, S-Lang has evolved as a language similar to C. It was developed by John E. Davis.</p><h4>Spin</h4><p>It is a multitasking object-oriented programming language whose compiler converts the Spin code into bytecodes. Multiple Spin code threads can run at a time, thus enabling multitasking. Spin was developed by Chip Gracey of Parallax.</p><figure><a href="https://clickhelp.co/free-download/responsive-layouts-getting-started-guide/?utm_source=medium-com&amp;utm_medium=responsive-banner&amp;utm_campaign=blogging"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*MMonANgTHB8TBVir9bo7sA.png" /></a></figure><h3>Functional Programming Languages</h3><blockquote><strong>Functional programming languages</strong> define every computation as a mathematical evaluation. They focus on the application of functions. Many of the functional programming languages are bound to mathematical calculations.</blockquote><h4>Charity</h4><p>It is a purely functional, not-Turing-complete language, which means that all its programs are guaranteed to terminate. Charity was designed at the University of Calgary, a public University in Canada.</p><h4>Clean</h4><p>It is a purely functional programming language that supports portability across platforms, automatic garbage collection, multiple data structures and referential transparency, which means that a function with a given input will always give the same output.</p><h4>Curry</h4><p>It is a functional logic programming language that implements functional and logic programming as well as constraint programming, wherein the relationships between variables are stated in the form of constraints.</p><h4>Erlang</h4><p>It is a concurrent programming language that includes a sequential subset, which supports functional programming. Ericsson developed Erlang as a distributed soft real-time and fault-tolerant language and released it as an open source computer programming language in 1998. It is one of the most popularly used functional programming languages.</p><h4>F#</h4><p>It targets the .NET Framework and supports both functional as well as imperative object-oriented programming. Don Syme at the Microsoft Research developed this language, which is now being developed at the Microsoft Developer Division. F Sharp, as it is called, will soon be integrated into the .NET Framework and Visual Studio.</p><h4>Haskell</h4><p>Named in honor of Haskell Curry, a logician, Haskell is a standardized purely functional language. It supports pattern matching, definable operators, single assignment, algebraic data types and recursive functions.</p><h4>Joy</h4><p>It is a purely functional language that is based on a composition of functions. Manfred von Thun of La Trobe University in Australia developed this language.</p><h4>Kite</h4><p>It came up in 2006 with a feature set consisting of a blend of object-oriented and functional programming features. It is a fast-running language. Interestingly, Kite uses the pipe character for functional calls rather than using the period or arrow characters in other languages.</p><h4>ML</h4><p>Robin Milner and his associates at the University of Edinburgh came up with ML in the 1970s.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Bradley Nice, Content Manager at <a href="https://clickhelp.com/online-documentation-tool/?utm_source=medium-com&amp;utm_medium=brad-top-link&amp;utm_campaign=blogging">ClickHelp.com — software documentation tool</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bYAIrVBRWSCCKnbtST8XTw.jpeg" /></figure><blockquote>Front-end development is like an ocean. You happen to have a ship, but no map. First learn the shallow waters, then go deep.</blockquote><p>Becoming a front-end developer is one of the hottest and most lucrative jobs in the job market today. There is always a high demand for highly skilled developers.</p><p>Front-end developer is the most popular term for a web developer who focuses on code which is run by the web browser. For a front-end developer the average salary is $75k to $100k for 2+ years experience.</p><p>A few traits of being a good front-end web developer are:</p><ul><li>Thorough</li><li>Empathetic</li><li>Strong communication skills</li><li>Good at working with diverse groups of people</li><li>Interested in design and aesthetics</li><li>The ability to visualize structure in a concept</li></ul><p>When we talk about the Front-End we are referring to the languages that are interpreted by the users browser as opposed to the Back-End which are the languages being interpreted on the server (of the website the user is connecting to). The Front-End languages that are interpreted by the browser are HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheet), and JavaScript and each serve a unique purpose.</p><p>So tip #1 is</p><h3>1. Learn HTML &amp; CSS</h3><p>I guess there’s no way around it. Learn HTML &amp; CSS. Why? Because the basics matter.</p><p>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the most fundamental building squares of web coding. Without these two things, you can’t make a site outline, and all you’ll wind up with is unformatted plain content on the screen.</p><p>There are all kinds of different online courses and books available on how to get started with HTML and CSS. For example, try out these:</p><blockquote><strong><em>Sites: </em></strong><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web"><em>Codecademy</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/map-aside#nested-collapseHTML5andCSS"><em>FreeCodeCamp.com</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://www.sololearn.com/Course/HTML/"><em>SoloLearn</em></a><em> (HTML), </em><a href="http://www.sololearn.com/Course/CSS/"><em>SoloLearn</em></a><em> (CSS), </em><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/learn/html"><em>Treehouse</em></a><em> (HTML), </em><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/learn/css"><em>Treehouse</em></a><em> (CSS), </em><a href="http://courses.tutsplus.com/courses/30-days-to-learn-html-css"><em>Tutsplus</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://www.atozcss.com/"><em>A to Z CSS</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/"><em>Dash</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://webaccessibility.withgoogle.com/course"><em>Web Accessibility</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://www.thehelloworldprogram.com/web-development/"><em>The Hello World</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css"><em>Khan Academy</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-html5-programming-from-scratch/"><em>HTML5 from Scratch</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/html-css/"><em>Sitepoint</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://usersnap.com/blog"><em>Usersnap</em></a></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Books: </em></strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/learn"><em>Mozilla</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/"><em>Dive into HTML5</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/"><em>HTML Dog</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/"><em>HTML &amp; CSS</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://joshondesign.com/p/books/canvasdeepdive/toc.html"><em>HTML Canvas</em></a></blockquote><blockquote>(c) <a href="https://medium.com/web-development-resources/the-best-websites-to-learn-coding-5e903400fdff#.p49c51fbp">The Best Websites to Learn Coding</a></blockquote><p>I also recommend developing some small UI elements for practicing your newly learned HTML &amp; CSS skills. <a href="http://codepen.io/">Codepen.io</a> is a great playground for that. Browse other people’s projects and participate in the community there.</p><figure><a href="https://clickhelp.co/free-download/responsive-layouts-getting-started-guide/?utm_source=medium-com&amp;utm_medium=responsive-banner&amp;utm_campaign=blogging"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*MMonANgTHB8TBVir9bo7sA.png" /></a></figure><h3>2. Build Things</h3><p>Playing around with (small) UI elements is one thing. Creating an actual landing page or website is something different. At some point, you will eventually start using JavaScript snippets.</p><p>JavaScript is a robust programming language and you can expect to spend much more time learning it than for HTML and CSS which are fairly simple in comparison.</p><p>After learning the fundamentals of JavaScript I would suggest learning more advanced topics such as JavaScript libraries like: jQuery, Underscore, React, Angular2, Riot, etc.</p><p><em>Check out a list of sites and books on them: </em><a href="https://medium.com/web-development-resources/the-best-websites-to-learn-coding-5e903400fdff#.p49c51fbp"><em>The Best Websites to Learn Coding</em></a></p><h3>3. Read, Read, Read</h3><p>I guess there’s no way around this. Believe it or not. Your reading skills greatly influence your path to becoming a great front-end developer. Especially when starting out, there’s a lot of reading required.</p><p>At first you’ll probably read a lot of articles, guides and manuals on how to do different things. You’ll also start reading other people’s code.</p><p><em>You might want to check: </em><a href="https://medium.com/web-development-zone/useful-docs-and-guides-for-front-end-developers-6a13fc395783#.uy224ee77"><em>Useful Docs and Guides for Front-End Developers</em></a></p><h3>4. Front-End Development Is Not Only About Building Websites</h3><p>If you followed my tips from 1 to 3, you have probably already done a course or have read a lot of tutorials and are now able to throw together a website.</p><p>However, that doesn’t equate to being a “front-end developer”. Knowing how to build a website is a very small part of the front-end puzzle.</p><p>There is a whole load of topics for you to learn. If we consider performance, testing, QA and many other areas, then you really need to become a deep diver as a front-end developer.</p><h3>5. Know Your Tools</h3><p>As you start your journey with front-end development, you will need to decide on your toolkit and the services you need to to make your life easier. Learning about the different tooling options is an important thing. Great tools will help you enhance and automate your front-end development workflow.</p><p><em>The following post might help you: </em><a href="https://medium.com/wd-tips-tricks/the-ultimate-list-of-best-free-tools-resources-for-front-end-web-developers-983c65de3300#.6ni3gt4qv"><em>The Ultimate List of Best Free Tools &amp; Resources for Front-End Web Developers</em></a></p><h3>6. Be The Middleman</h3><p>As a front-end developer, you need to be aware that you put yourself in some kind of middleman role. As a middleman, you are in touch with QA people, clients, UX experts as well as other developers. You will need to take different perspectives into consideration.</p><p>That is why, besides learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you need to make sure to be able to communicate clearly.</p><h3>7. Don’t Rush And Ask Questions</h3><p>Along the way, you will ask yourself why you do this and you may want to just stop. It may be tempting to just give up. But don’t. If you’re at that point, I have only one advice for you:</p><p><strong>DO_NOT_GIVE_UP</strong></p><p>Set aside one or two hours every other day to learn. Take a lot of breaks and make sure that you really know the basics. And never rush.</p><p>The basics form the foundation which will help you get to the next level.</p><p>If you feel stuck, don’t be afraid to ask questions. Everyone goes through this phase and having the patience to stick it out will help you come out in the end as a pro in front-end development.</p><h3>Wrapping up</h3><p>The path to becoming a front-end developer will definitely take some time. As presented in this blog post, becoming a front-end developer is not only about learning various front-end frameworks and programming languages. It’s about the interaction, responsibilities and roles as a front-end developer.</p><p>Because the web is a rapidly evolving universe, great front-end developers should never stop learning. Even little things like following front-end experts on twitter will have impact on your learning curve.</p><p>You need to have some patience to get there. Rushing doesn’t make sense because it won’t make you happy. Never forget to have fun while learning and experimenting.</p><p>Have a nice day!</p><p>Bradley Nice,<br>Content Manager at <a href="https://clickhelp.com/online-documentation-tool/?utm_source=medium-com&amp;utm_medium=brad-top-link&amp;utm_campaign=blogging">ClickHelp.com — best online documentation tool for SaaS vendors</a></p><figure><a href="https://clickhelp.com/online-documentation-tool/?utm_source=medium-com&amp;utm_medium=footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=blogging"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*Sjn_ekNvtfPuKl9Qypm-_Q.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://t.me/clickhelp_technicalwritingblog"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*3350NKjARLehsI6s" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=cb7123bc84bb" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/web-development-zone/where-to-start-as-a-front-end-web-developer-cb7123bc84bb">Where To Start As A Front-End Web Developer?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/web-development-zone">Web Development Zone</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

And because each set of icons is unique, you can give a different voice to a design, just by switching between sets.</p><p>Today I’ve put together some icon sets of different themes. Some of them have been designed by leading names in the field, others are just regular designers who wanted to give something back to the community.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><h3><a

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y-Dv0H4PIK72Qo1NP7MHPQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="http://www.wocintechchat.com/blog/wocintechphotos">WOCINTECH</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Focus is key. <em>Maaajor</em> <em>key</em>. </strong>This has been the single most important factor on my coding journey. And it’s freaking hard. Because I don’t just learn, I <em>obsess</em>. I want to know EVERYTHING there is to know and all at once and right now.</p><p>For awhile I didn’t know where to start. Google has a <a href="https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html">nice</a> list of where to start for those wanting to delve into technical development. I used this list, along with some others, and quickly found myself overwhelmed. No matter how many lists I read and how many times I tried to form my own list of what I should learn, I ended up frustrated. Then when I would take a break and get on social media, I would see someone tweet about ‘Swift’ or ‘Ruby’ or ‘css animations’ and end up in a Google rabbit hole.</p><p>Technically, I was still learning, but I was not truly understanding. Most of the things I was reading about I could not do yet until I had learned other basic fundamentals first. This cycle continued until I made myself focus on learning one (or a few things) at a time. I enrolled in a <a href="http://resources.skillcrush.com/skillcrush-career-blueprints">Skillcrush Blueprint</a>, and that aided in providing a more focused, structured learning environment. My experience with the online course made it easier for me when I supplemented my learning on my own time, without an instructor or classmates.</p><p><strong>Read — Search — Ask! </strong>Part of the reason I tend to skip around so much (and maybe you too) is because when I get stuck, I get frustrated and then distracted.</p><p>The first time I saw the ‘Read-Search-Ask’ guideline was on <a href="https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/FreeCodeCamp-Get-Help">FreeCodeCamp’s site</a> and have practiced it ever since. As an avid reader, reading documentation has been very helpful and I find myself doing this the most.</p><p>When I can’t find what I’m looking for in documentation, I turn to Google. I’m always pleasantly surprised to find that every code-related question I’ve googled (so far), has already been answered, mostly on Stackoverflow. As someone who tends putting off asking for help as a last resort, it can be reassuring to know there’s others out there, who once were exactly where you are.</p><p><strong>Twitter is your friend.</strong> Social media has been quite handy during my coding adventures. I began following women in tech on Twitter. I figured that if they were successful in the field, then I wanted to know what they were thinking, reading, and tweeting. I started consuming whatever blogs they read and podcasts they listened to. This has expanded my knowledge in a way I never expected. There are some women I have been able to connect with online and/or in real life, and the support has been amazing.</p><p><strong>But also, make real friends</strong>. At tech events. And meetups. And hackathons. And… well, you get the idea? You need to leave your house, get out there, and actually meet programmers. It’s intimidating, and nerve-wracking but keep doing it until it’s <strong>not</strong>. I was <em>terrified </em>at the idea of going to tech events. I figured people were going to smell the “new” on me. I thought only ~super experienced~ coders went to these events.</p><p>Then I thought about how it doesn’t matter, how no one would be daring enough to come up to me and tell me I did not belong. So I made myself go to a coding event after only having been coding for 2 weeks. And guess what? I didn’t die. I had fun, learned a lot, and met some great people. At my very first meetup, I sat across from an awesome UX designer who partnered up with me and assisted me throughout the duration of the event. Only to find out after, once she gave me her business card, she was a co-founder of a local web and mobile development company. I would miss opportunities like this, to connect with local community [technology] leaders, if I had just let self-doubt win.</p><p><strong>Up next: </strong>I’ve learned so much in such a short span of time, that I’m incredibly excited for what’s to come. I’m going to keep attending meetups. I plan to attend a hackathon before 2016 ends. I will be attending my first tech conference in November. I plan to continue fostering connections with other women and POC in tech. And my hope is to give back to others, in that sweet space where tech, social justice, and empathy intersect.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8ad5c9c178a" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/web-development-zone/what-ive-learned-after-three-months-of-coding-almost-daily-8ad5c9c178a">What I’ve Learned After Three Months of Coding (Almost) Daily</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/web-development-zone">Web Development Zone</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
